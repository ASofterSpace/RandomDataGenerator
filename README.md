# RandomDataGenerator

**Class:** Utility

**Language:** Java

**Platform:** Windows / Linux

This generates random SQL data, e.g. by default random user names.

## Setup

Download our Toolbox-Java (which is a separate project here on github) into an adjacent directory on your hard drive.

Start the build by calling under Windows:

```
build.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
build.sh
```

## Run

To start up the RandomDataGenerator project after it has been built, you can call under Windows:

```
run.bat inputfile
```

Or under Linux:

```
run.sh inputfile
```

Where the `inputfile` is a text file containing one user id on each row.
